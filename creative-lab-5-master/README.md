# creative-lab-5

This project was created for a web publishing course as a creative project to 
display an understanding of principles covered in the class.

This project is a recreation of the online game "Neopets" using the knowledge my team had of 
HTML, CSS, Angular, Javascript and Databases (MongoDB).
